# Database For To Do Task

This is the script for creating a database tables for the to do app

## Run

- Start by doing a `go mod init` to initialize the main.go file as a package.
- After the first step, do a `go mod tidy` to install the modules in the package.
- Finally start the code with `go run main.go` or you could first do a `go build main.go` before `./main`. NB: Both works perfectly fine.
